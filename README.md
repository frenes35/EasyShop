# EasyShop Project

## Description of the Project

EasyShop is a working e-commerce website. It uses a Spring Boot API for the backend and a MySQL database to store data.
Users can log in, look at products by category or price, add them to a cart, and order them.
The project includes fixing bugs in the API and adding new features.
The goal is to keep the backend running smoothly.
